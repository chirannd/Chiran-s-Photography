# **Photography is More Than Just an Art**
For me, photography has been an oppertunity to escape the rigors and uncertainties of life and immerse my self in my attentive conciousness of the enviornment around me as I search for the perfect subject to take a photograph of. Hence, I practice photography as I would practice meditation: by guiding my conciousness to the here and now. This holds true specially when I am in the wilderness in the search of a bird or other animal that can pose as the subject for my photograph. The act of waliking in the undergrowth with the rustle of the foliage beneath my feat creates a special sesnse of belonging and connectedness with natuire- a feeling of bliss. Often, when we are so distratced by thoughts of what is conventional for modern-day life such as the urge to go on our cell phones or stress about your schedule. We never really take the time to appreciate and capture a moment of time in the absolute serenity of the wilderness. This feeling will stay with you even when you leave the forest. 
## An Amateur Photographer's Best Pictures

This picture was taken as I was hiking through a beatiful hillside overlooking the Laguna coast on an afternoon. I believe it is a Jack Rabbit.

This picture was taken at our very own school as this bird was taking shelter from the rain underneath one of the benches at sophmore square. This picture was taken on March and more specifically, the last day of school. Actually, it was just the day we were announcd that school would be closed for two weeks (which is still physically closed due to the pandemic).

Taken as I was walking through a semi-wintery forest in Big Bear. This was around February of 2020 when the snow had begun to thaw. I believe it is a mockingbird.

Taken on the same day as the previous picture. I believe this one to be a Blue Jay
