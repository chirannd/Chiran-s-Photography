# **Photography is More Than Just an Art**
For me, photography has been an oppertunity to escape the rigors and uncertainties of life and immerse my self in my attentive conciousness of the enviornment around me as I search for the perfect subject to take a photograph of. Hence, I practice photography as I would practice meditation: by guiding my conciousness to the here and now. This holds true specially when I am in the wilderness in the search of a bird or other animal that can pose as the subject for my photograph. The act of waliking in the undergrowth with the rustle of the foliage beneath my feat creates a special sesnse of belonging and connectedness with natuire- a feeling of bliss. Often, when we are so distratced by thoughts of what is conventional for modern-day life such as the urge to go on our cell phones or stress about your schedule. We never really take the time to appreciate and capture a moment of time in the absolute serenity of the wilderness. This feeling will stay with you even when you leave the forest.
